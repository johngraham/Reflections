When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories would be useful when I wanted to share, collaborate, or backup copies of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Given that remote repositories can have multiple people who commit, an automatic update might introduce changes that you aren't aware of, nor wanting.
