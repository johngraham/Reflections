What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new folder called .git is created with files and information for a new repository. This is needed so that future commits have a database to be stored in.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a logical "bridge" between the workign directory and the repository. The working directory is the actual real files being worked on, sitting on your hard drive. The repository are the records of the files wanted to be kept in version control, which come from the real files in the working directory. The staging area allows a scratchpad to list all the files for a commit to the repository, in case a commit has to be done at two different times.
